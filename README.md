# SPA

GitHub repository for SPA impact crater ejecta analysis using iSale3D. The simulation data is available at [insert simulation link here]. 

The main objective of this project is to determine the distribution of impact ejecta during the excavation stage of the impact, when material is ejected ballistically from inside the bowl shaped cavity. The model parameters for the analysis are listed in the table below [insert table below]. Two evaluation scenarios are analyzed: 50 K/km (hotter) with 10 km/s impact velocity and 10 K/km (colder) with 15 km/s impact velocity.
